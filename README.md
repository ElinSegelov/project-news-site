# News Site

## The problem

The objective was to create a news site with a navbar, a big news section and a grid of small news.

I used the sketch provided by Technigo as a starting point and then made some changes on paper. The site mainly consists of HTML and CSS but also Javascript for hamburger menu and carousel functionality.
I donâ€™t know enough JavaScript yet so I have used the following resources as guidance and inspiration.

Carousel

To further develop the site, the articles could pop out in a box on top of the site when being clicked.
